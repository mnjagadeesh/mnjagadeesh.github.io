I was searching for origin of VU, a prefix used for Indian hams, I stumbled
upon

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_in_India

It says VU is “Indian amateur radio operators are allotted only the VU call-
sign prefix. The V or Viceroy, series prefix was allotted to British
colonies.”

Some senior ham was telling me it was for Viceroy’s Unit.

Now we are close to celebrating 70th year of Independence of India, why still
we be known as VUs? Can’t that be changed? What is there to be proud of?
