# New experiment with Reiki.

This is my very recent experiment that I wanted to share with you all. Last
Sunday about 10 cyclists had trip to Turahalli forest. Ride started from
Nagarabhavi. We started around 6:00 AM and back to home by 9:30 AM.

I returned home, I was too tired. Had to lot of weekend work to finish.
Thought of postponing all of them but I could not. Then just a thought came to
my mind to use reiki to recharge myself. I was excited to see effect.

I gave a reiki to myself for about 45 mins. Result was amazing. I was totally
refreshed and turbo charged.

Just sharing this incident if anyone else had this kind experience too OR
willing to have it.
