My Name is Jagadeesh N. Malakannavar. By profession I am a software engineer. I
live in Bangalore, India.

I love building software tools, gluing tools and automation. I use Perl, Python,
Go for scripting. Emacs is my productivity tool and Linux is my operating system.

Apart from helping on opensource automation, I am interested in Techtalks.

I am a cyclist. I use bicycle to commute to work. I prefer MTB and hybrid cycles.

I am a Amateur Radio operator with callsign vu3jnm. Mostly on VHF and 20 meter.

I am a reiki master too. I keep experimenting with a lot. Reach out me for
distance healing.
